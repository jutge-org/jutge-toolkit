# The answers is 42

## Features

- Simple quiz with only one question
- The answer is always 42

## Abstract

This repository contains a simple implementation of a quiz application that asks a single question: "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?" The correct answer is always 42, inspired by Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

## Note

It is not yet possible to have more than language of a quiz problem in a single repository. Different languages require a language directory each (even if there is only one language).
