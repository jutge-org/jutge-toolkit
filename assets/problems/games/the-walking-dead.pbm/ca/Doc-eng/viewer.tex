\section{The Viewer}

We know describe the viewer:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item
  In the upper part there are buttons that allow us to reproduce or stop the game, go to
  the beginning or to the end, enable or disable the animation mode or obtaining a help window
  with more ways to control the visualization. You will also see the current round and a button
  to close the game. A horizontal toggle bar shows in which point of the game the current round is.
  
\item
  In the left column, each player appears with her name and color. Below, we can see the
  current score, the number of alive units and the player strength. In the game played in
  Jutge.org, we can also see the percentage of CPU time that has been used (if consumed, a message
  'out' is displayed). In the upper-right part we can see the colors of the players, ordered by score.
  
\item Cells have the color of the player that owns them. Otherwise, they are white.

\item Waste cells are dark grey.

\item Alive units are represented as circles of the corresponding color. If they are becoming zombies, they are squares.

\item Dead units are represented by a cross.

\item Zombies are represented by a red square with a black outer frame.
  
\item Food units are represented by a red circle with a black outer frame.
