\Problem{Which one is missing?}

\Statement

Johny has a list of objects, labeled between 1 and $n$, but he lost one of them. He wants to know which one is missing.

\medskip

Write a program that reads sequences with all the numbers between 1 and $n$ but one, and tells which one is missing.

\Input

Input consists of several sequences.
Every sequence begins with a number $n$ between~1 and~$10^4$ followed by $n - 1$ natural numbers.
Every number between 1 and $n$ appears exactly once, except one of them, which is missing.

\Output

For every sequence, print the missing number.
