# Additional guidelines for Python

- Use f-strings for string formatting when possible.

- Use type hints for function definitions. Do not use old-style type hints such as `List[int]` with `List` imported from `typing`, but use modern syntax such as `list[int]`.

- Ensure that the generated Python3 code follows best practices, including proper indentation, use of functions, use of docstrings, and adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.

- Each function should be documented with a docstring.
