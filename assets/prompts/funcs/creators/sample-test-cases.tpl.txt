Now, write a {{proglang}} program that serves as sample test cases of the {{functions}} functions.

This program should be a sequence of print statements that call each of the required functions
with some sample inputs.

Sample test cases must be written in {{proglang}} and follow the specification of the functions.

Sample test cases should be relatively small but cover interesting cases but not all edge cases.

If the problem statement features some examples, include them as part of the sample test cases.

Do not include comments now.

Separate the tests for each function with an empty line.

Do not add any formatting, markdown or code fences.
