Now, write a Python doctest with the same inputs as in this test cases:

{{sampleTests}}

Do not include comments now.

Separate the tests for each function with an empty line.

Do not add any formatting, markdown or code fences. Do not output empty lines.

Output should follow the format of Python doctests. For instance:
>>> factorial(5)
120
>>> factorial(0)
1
