Now, write a sample test case file to illustrate the input that the program must read according to the problem statement.

Only the input should be given, the output will be computed from it.
Sample test cases must be written in plain text format and in the same format that the program reads.
Sample test cases should be relatively small but cover interesting cases but not all edge cases.
If the problem statement features some examples, include them as part of the sample test cases.
