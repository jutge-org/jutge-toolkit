\Problem{Hello world!}

\Statement

Write a program that prints a line with the message \qq{Hello world!}.

\Input

There is not input: the program does not read anything.

\Output

Print exactly the required text in a line.

\Observation

This problem is atypical, because we do not need to read any input,
and we always print the same. It is very easy!
